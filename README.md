📘 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI.
The goal is to analyze global EV adoption, identify top EV models, study manufacturer contributions, examine BEV/PHEV trends, and understand the evolution of Electric Vehicles across years and locations.

The dashboard combines Python, SQL, and Power BI to provide end-to-end data analysis — from preprocessing to visualization — helping users understand key market insights in the fast-growing EV industry.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python → Data cleaning, preprocessing & EDA
Pandas, NumPy → Exploratory analysis
SQL (MySQL) → Data querying & transformations
Power BI → Data modeling & dashboard creation
Dataset → EV market dataset (sourced from Medium)

🗂️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Python – Initial Data Preparation
Loaded the EV dataset
Cleaned missing values
Converted date/year columns
Performed initial analysis.

2️⃣ SQL – Structured Analysis

Created database & tables

Queried metrics such as:

BEV vs PHEV counts

Top models

Manufacturer contributions

Year-wise EV growth

Used grouping & aggregation for insights

3️⃣ Power BI – Dashboard Development

Built KPIs for:

Total Vehicles

Average Electric Range

Total BEV

Total PHEV

Designed charts for:

Top EV models

Top EV manufacturers

EV trend over years

EV distribution by city (map)

Added slicers for model year & manufacturer

⭐ Key Features

⚡ EV KPI Metrics: Total Vehicles, BEV, PHEV, Avg. Electric Range

📅 EV Trend Over Years: Growth in BEV & PHEV adoption

🚗 Top EV Models: Model Y, Model 3, Leaf, Model S, Bolt EV, Model X

🏭 Top 5 EV Manufacturers: Porsche, MINI, Dodge, Smart, Alfa Romeo

🗺️ Global EV Distribution: Interactive map showing EV count by city

🎛️ Slicers & Filters: Filter by model year & EV type

🎨 Clean UI layout built with sector-aligned visuals

🎯 Insights Summary

Model Y and Model 3 dominate EV adoption with highest vehicle counts.

BEVs significantly outnumber PHEVs, reflecting global EV market shift.

EV adoption saw its biggest spike after 2015, aligning with global EV policy boosts.

Porsche and Mini represent major contributions among manufacturers.

Cities in North America & Europe show highest EV concentration.

EV range and adoption have drastically increased over the last decade.
